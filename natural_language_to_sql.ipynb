            "1. Avoid using functions on columns in the WHERE clause if possible. In this case, the `YEAR()` function is applied to the `HireDate` column, which can hinder index usage and lead to potentially slower query performance.\n",

            "2. Instead of using the `YEAR()` function, it's better to compare the `HireDate` directly with the range of dates for the year 2019. This approach allows for better utilization of indexes on the `HireDate` column.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. By specifying a range condition based on the actual calendar dates for the year 2019, the database optimizer can make use of any existing indexes on the `HireDate` column efficiently.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. The optimized query provided compares the `HireDate` column against specific date ranges for the year 2019, ensuring accurate results while potentially improving overall query performance.\n",
